Hello! I am a Ph.D. student in astronomy at Cornell University advised by Prof. Dong Lai. 

My research interests include exoplanetary dynamics, protoplanetary disks, and the dynamical evolution of embedded black holes in the AGN disks. I study the theories of these topics with <i>N</i>-body and hydrodynamics simulations. Please check out the [Research page](https://lijiaru0305.github.io/publications/) for more details.

I joined Cornell as a graduate student in 2017. I also spent two years of my grad school at Los Alamos National Laboratory, where I worked with Dr. Hui Li and his group. My bachelor's degree was obtained at University of Toronto at Scarborough, where I worked with on Prof. Artur Izmaylov on quantum chemistry. 

Before I started my university study, I was born and raised in Hangzhou, China.
