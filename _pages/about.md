Hello! I am a Ph.D. student in astronomy at Cornell University, advised by Prof. Dong Lai. 

My research interests include exoplanetary dynamics, protoplanetary disks, and the dynamical evolution of embedded black holes in the active galactic nucleus disks. I primarily study theories in these topics using <i>N</i>-body and hydrodynamics simulations. Please check out the [Research page](https://lijiaru0305.github.io/publications/) for more details.

I joined Cornell as a graduate student in 2017. I also spent two years of grad school at Los Alamos National Laboratory, where I worked with Dr. Hui Li and his group as a CSES student fellow. I received my bachelor's degree at the University of Toronto at Scarborough, where I worked with Prof. Artur Izmaylov on quantum chemistry. 

Before I started my university study, I was born and raised in Hangzhou, China.
